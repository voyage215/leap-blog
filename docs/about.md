This is my activity blog encompassing all that I learn on a daily basis. I am a Masters in Data Science student, and I spend my time exploring new topics and sharpening my rusty tools. I love to learn new topics and this blog will dive in to the details of the topics I come across while learning. Please have a look at my [Resume](leap-blog/resume) for a better understanding of who I am in a short and succinct description. 


Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub]() or [ask me on Linkedin]().

Thanks for reading!
